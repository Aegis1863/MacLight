# MacLight

Code of AAMAS2025 full paper "[**MacLight: Multi-scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for Traffic Signal Control**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15703)".

## Package Requirements

Python 3.8, torch, numpy, pandas, tqdm, eclipse-sumo, traci, libsumo, sumo-rl

Except for torch, the other packages can be installed by running the commands in the `install.sh` script. Torch needs to be installed separately.

## Environment Setup

1. Use `conda` to create a virtual environment, specifying `python=3.8`. Let's assume the environment name is `your_env`.

2. Install torch following the instructions on the official Torch website.

3. Use `conda` or `pip` to install is ok for

   ```ssh
   pip install eclipse-sumo
   pip install traci
   pip install libsumo
   pip install sumo-rl
   pip install gymnasium
   pip install pettingzoo
   ```

4. Set the SUMO path. On Linux:

   ```bash
   export SUMO_HOME=miniconda3/envs/{your_env}/lib/{python3.8}/site-packages/sumo
   ```

   (Where `miniconda` might be `anaconda`). On Windows, set an environment variable pointing to the SUMO folder.

## Run MacLight

To run MacLight:

```bash
python run_Ours.py -w 1 -t block -l normal
```

After the execution is complete, the data will be saved in the `data/plot_data/` folder.

## Test your method

### Experimental Limitations

If you want to transfer this method, you can adjust the road `xml` file in the SUMO interface in `run_{algorithm}.py`. But it cannot be transferred arbitrarily because we have specified the data organization, that is, the road network needs to be a grid.

You can also refer to our method for constructing dynamic traffic flow and our method for constructing variational autoencoders.

**Dynamic traffic flow:** `env\wrap\random_block.py`. We also give a guide on how to build it, see the subsequent section `Dynamic Traffic Flow Construction Guide`.

**variational autoencoders:** `net\net.py`.

### Train Your Method in Our Road Network

#### Road network files

If you plan to test your method on our road network, you can find road network files in `env\map`.

- `ff.net.xml` is road network. It is unchanging, and the difference between the different environments is the traffic flow file.
- `ff_normal.rou.xml` is traffic flow file under normal pressure (Normal&Block).
- `ff_hard.rou.xml` is traffic flow file under high pressure (Peak).

It should be noted that the normal pressure we set is also relatively high.

**Traffic flow reference table:**

#### example to create an enviroment

Our environment interface inherits from [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and [sumo-rl](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl), so you can easily migrate your algorithms.

1. Static environment:

   The direction of the vehicle is completely fixed and the route will not be changed.

   ```python
   env = sumo_rl.parallel_env(net_file='env/map/ff.net.xml',
                              route_file=f'env/map/ff_normal.rou.xml',  # Could be `ff_hard.rou.xml`
                              num_seconds=args.seconds,
                              use_gui=False,
                              sumo_warnings=False,
                              additional_sumo_cmd='--no-step-log')
   ```

2. Dynamic environment

   We define the `BlockStreet` class, which can randomly block certain roads, so that vehicles reselect the best route, which will cause sudden changes in traffic flow on certain roads.

   ```python
   from env.wrap.random_block import BlockStreet
   # block_num: Number of blocked roads, like 8
   # seconds: Simulation seconds, up to 3600
   env = BlockStreet(env, block_num, seconds)
   ```

Additionally, we strongly recommend that you set the following environment variables to get the fastest possible simulation (although it may still be slower):

```python
import os
os.environ['LIBSUMO_AS_TRACI'] = '1'
```

# Dynamic Traffic Flow Construction Guide

## Block Environment Code

Refer to the file `env\wrap\random_block.py`.

## Simulation Environment Creation

After installing SUMO and configuring its environment variables, you can create the simulation environment.

1. Use the following command to create a simple road network:

   ```bash
   netgenerate --grid --grid.number=6 --grid.length=200 --default.lanenumber=6 -o ff.net.xml
   ```

2. In `netedit`, manually delete the surrounding roads and the corner nodes.
3. Create traffic lights:

   ```bash
   netconvert --sumo-net-file ff.net.xml --tls.guess --output-file ff.net.xml
   ```

4. Delete the left-turn and straight signals for the left lanes of the traffic lights.
5. Modify the traffic light phases in the `ff.net.xml` file (do not use the default phases) by locating the `</tlLogic>` tag and adjusting all traffic light phases to:

   ```xml
   <phase duration="30" state="grrrgGGrgrrrgGGr"/>
   <phase duration="3"  state="grrrgGGrgrrrgyyr"/>
   <phase duration="15" state="grrrgGGGgrrrgrrr"/>
   <phase duration="3"  state="grrrgyyygrrrgrrr"/>
   <phase duration="15" state="grrrgrrrgrrrgGGG"/>
   <phase duration="3"  state="grrrgrrrgrrrgyyG"/>
   <phase duration="15" state="grrrgrrGgrrrgrrG"/>
   <phase duration="3"  state="grrrgrrygrrrgrry"/>
   <phase duration="30" state="gGGrgrrrgGGrgrrr"/>
   <phase duration="3"  state="gyyrgrrrgGGrgrrr"/>
   <phase duration="15" state="grrrgrrrgGGGgrrr"/>
   <phase duration="3"  state="grrrgrrrgyyygrrr"/>
   ```

## Vehicle ID: 0â€“8999

To get the list of vehicle IDs currently operating in the system:

```python
traci.vehicle.getIDList()
```

To reroute based on travel time:

```python
traci.vehicle.rerouteTraveltime(vehicle_id)
```

## Map

## Blocking Roads

To block a road by reducing its speed limit:

```python
traci.edge.setMaxSpeed(edge, 1)
```

## ID List of All Lanes

```python
['A1B1', 'A2B2', 'A3B3', 'A4B4',
 'B0B1', 'B1A1', 'B1B0', 'B1B2',
 'B1C1', 'B2A2', 'B2B1', 'B2B3',

 'E4E3', 'E4E5', 'E4F4', 'E5E4',
 'F1E1', 'F2E2', 'F3E3', 'F4E4']
```

## Restricting the Central Area as a Starting Point

Refer to the `ff.dst.xml` and `ff.src.xml` files to ensure that roads in the central area are not used as starting points. Use the corresponding parameter when generating trips with `randomTrips.py`: `--weights-prefix ff` (no suffix is required).

Allowed starting edges:

```python
["A1B1", "B1A1", "A2B2", "B2A2", "A3B3",
"B3A3", "B4A4", "A4B4", "E1F1", "F1E1",
"E4F4", "F4E4", "E2F2", "F2E2", "E3F3",
"F3E3", "B1B0", "B0B1", "C1C0", "C0C1",
"D1D0", "D0D1", "E1E0", "E0E1", "B5B4",
"B4B5", "C5C4", "C4C5", "D5D4", "D4D5",
"E5E4", "E4E5"]
```

Prohibited starting edges:

```python
['B1B2', 'B1C1', 'B2B1', 'B2B3', 'B2C2',
 'B3B2', 'B3B4', 'B3C3', 'B4B3', 'B4B5',
 'B4C4', 'B5B4', 'C1B1', 'C1C2', 'C1D1',
 'C2B2', 'C2C1', 'C2C3', 'C2D2', 'C3B3',
 'C3C2', 'C3C4', 'C3D3', 'C4B4', 'C4C3',
 'C4D4', 'D1C1', 'D1D2', 'D1E1', 'D2C2',
 'D2D1', 'D2D3', 'D2E2', 'D3C3', 'D3D2',
 'D3D4', 'D3E3', 'D4C4', 'D4D3', 'D4E4',
 'E1D1', 'E1E2', 'E2D2', 'E2E1', 'E2E3',
 'E3D3', 'E3E2', 'E3E4', 'E4D4', 'E4E3']
```

These edges may be blocked, so they cannot be set as start or end points.
